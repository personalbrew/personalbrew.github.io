	<h3><i>"Coffee is beautiful and can be way more than just a beverage"</i></h3>
	The journey of Personal Brew Coffee started back in 2023 after a roadtrip to Norway and a visit at Tim Wendelboe's Cafe in Oslo.
  Since then we roast coffee on a small drum roaster. The roaster is a Kaleido M1 sample roaster with batch size of up to 200g.
  As a result, Personal Brew Coffee offers bags where each bag is one individual roast batch.
